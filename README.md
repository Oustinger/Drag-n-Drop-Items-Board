# Getting Started with Drag-n-Drop Items Board


## Description

This is a small project in which I implemented a list of items and a whiteboard using JS Drag-n-Drop functionality where you can arrange items, save the current nesting state to a file, and load it back.


## Quick Start Guide

### *First way:*

To use this application you can navigate to this [github-page](https://oustinger.github.io/Drag-n-Drop-Items-Board).

### *Second way:*

Clone the project and open `index.html` file.

**Please note:** if you want to export file twice, just reload the page before second operation.
